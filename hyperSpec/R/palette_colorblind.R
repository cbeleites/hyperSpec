#' @title Color Suggestions for `hyperSpec` Users
#'
#' @description
#' In \pkg{hyperSpec} the user may use any color name/format known to `R`.
#' An important fact to keep in mind is that most people with normal vision
#' cannot distinguish more than about 8-12 colors, and doing so depends upon
#' the viewing circumstances: if on paper, printer, ink and paper type all
#' matter, and if on a screen, the background color makes a big difference.
#' Further, color-blind individuals have additional challenges. A great
#' discussion of color issues can be found in the \pkg{colorspace} package.
#' The [\pkg{Polychrome}](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Polychrome)
#' package has further discussion and utilities for choosing qualitative
#' colorschemes, including those for color-blind individuals.
#'
#' `palette_colorblind` is a selection of seven colors suitable for use on
#' screens by people
#' with normal color vision, as well as people with the most common type of
#' colorblindness, deutanomaly. The last color is a shade of yellow with a
#' gold tone. In some  viewing circumstances this may be hard to see on a
#' white background.
#' You can see how these colors perform at this

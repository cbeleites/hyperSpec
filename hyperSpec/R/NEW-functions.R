#' Future functions
#'
#' These functions will be introduced in \pkg{hyperSpec} v1.0 and will replace
#' some current functions. Now they appear here just for compatibility with
#' other packages, which should be released on CRAN. They are not intended to
#' be used by \pkg{hyperSpec} v0.100 users directly.

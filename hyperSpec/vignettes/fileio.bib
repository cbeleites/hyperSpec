  abstract = {JCAMP-DX is a standard file form for exchange of infrared spectra
	and related chemical and physical information between spectrometer
	data systems of different manufacture, main-frame time-sharing systems,
	general purpose lab computers, and personal computers. It is compatible
	with all media: telephone, magnetic, optical disk, magnetic tape,
	and even the printed page (via optical reader). All data are stored
	as labeled fields of variable length using printable ASCII characters.
	A JCAMP-DX spectrum is a text file which can be viewed, corrected,
	and annotated with a text editor. The present focus is on infrared
	spectra, but JCAMP-DX can easily accommodate Raman, UV, NMR, mass,
	and other types of spectra, x-ray powder patterns, chromatograms,
	thermograms, and other plots which require the capability of representing
	contours as well as peak position and intensity. JCAMP-DX also provides
	for combining adequate information about the sample and method of
	observation with its spectrum.}
